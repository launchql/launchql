# Non-Transaction Mode Error Handling in LaunchQL Migration System

## Executive Summary

**KEY FINDING: Non-transaction mode ALREADY stops immediately when errors are thrown. No code changes are needed.**

After thorough investigation of the LaunchQL migration system's error handling behavior, we have confirmed that non-transaction mode (`useTransaction: false`) correctly stops deployment at the first error, just like transaction mode. The user's concern about non-transaction mode "continuing after failures" was based on a misinterpretation of test results.

## Error Handling Flow Analysis

### Current Behavior (Correct)

Both transaction and non-transaction modes follow the same error handling pattern:

1. **Deploy each change in sequence**
2. **On error**: Log failure event ‚Üí Log error details ‚Üí Set failed flag ‚Üí **THROW ERROR (stops deployment)**
3. **Result**: Deployment loop terminates immediately on first failure

### Code Location: `packages/core/src/migrate/client.ts` Lines 213-284

```typescript
try {
  // Execute deployment change
  await executeQuery(context, 'CALL launchql_migrate.deploy(...)', [...]);
  deployed.push(change.name);
  log.success(`Successfully ${logOnly ? 'logged' : 'deployed'}: ${change.name}`);
} catch (error: any) {
  // Log failure event outside of transaction
  await this.eventLogger.logEvent({
    eventType: 'deploy',
    changeName: change.name,
    project: plan.project,
    errorMessage: error.message || 'Unknown error',
    errorCode: error.code || null,
    stackTrace: error.stack || null
  });

  // Build comprehensive error message
  const errorLines = [];
  errorLines.push(`Failed to deploy ${change.name}:`);
  // ... error details ...
  
  log.error(errorLines.join('\n'));
  failed = change.name;
  throw error; // ‚Üê THIS STOPS THE DEPLOYMENT LOOP IN BOTH MODES
}
```

**Critical Point**: The `throw error` statement on line 284 terminates the deployment loop immediately, regardless of transaction mode.

## Test Evidence

### Test: "constraint violation without transaction - partial deployment"

**Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/projects/deploy-failure-scenarios.test.ts` Lines 76-145

**Test Plan**: 4 changes in sequence
1. `create_table` ‚úÖ Success
2. `add_record` ‚úÖ Success  
3. `violate_constraint` ‚ùå **FAILS - DEPLOYMENT STOPS HERE**
4. `final_change` ‚è∏Ô∏è **NEVER ATTEMPTED**

**Key Evidence from Test Comments** (Line 88):
```typescript
// * - 4th change never attempted (deployment stops at first failure)
```

**Key Evidence from Test Assertions** (Lines 137-138):
```typescript
const finalRecord = await db.query("SELECT * FROM test_products WHERE sku = 'PROD-002'");
expect(finalRecord.rows).toHaveLength(0); // Proves final_change was never executed
```

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ 2 successful changes deployed and persisted
- ‚ùå 1 failure logged  
- ‚è∏Ô∏è 1 change never attempted (deployment stopped)
- üìä Total events: 3 (2 success + 1 failure)

This test **proves** that non-transaction mode stops immediately on the first error.

### Test: "verify database state after constraint failure"

**Location**: `packages/core/__tests__/projects/deploy-failure-scenarios.test.ts` Lines 147-232

This test runs **BOTH** transaction and non-transaction modes sequentially:

1. **First run** (Lines 178-190): `useTransaction: true` ‚Üí 1 failure event
2. **Second run** (Lines 192-214): `useTransaction: false` ‚Üí 1 additional failure event  
3. **Total events**: 4 (2 success from non-transaction + 2 failures from both runs)

## Code Analysis

### withTransaction Function Behavior

**Location**: `packages/core/src/migrate/utils/transaction.ts` Lines 47-51

```typescript
if (!options.useTransaction) {
  // No transaction - use pool directly
  log.debug('Executing without transaction');
  return fn({ client: pool, isTransaction: false, queryHistory, addQuery });
}
```

**Key Insight**: In non-transaction mode, `withTransaction` simply executes the provided function directly without any transaction wrapper. **Errors propagate identically in both modes.**

### Error Propagation Comparison

| Mode | Error Flow |
|------|------------|
| **Transaction** | Error thrown ‚Üí Caught by withTransaction ‚Üí ROLLBACK ‚Üí Re-throw ‚Üí Deployment stops |
| **Non-Transaction** | Error thrown ‚Üí **Directly propagates** ‚Üí Deployment stops |

**Result**: Both modes terminate the deployment loop immediately when `throw error` is executed.

### Deployment Loop Structure

**Location**: `packages/core/src/migrate/client.ts` Lines 151-292

```typescript
await withTransaction(targetPool, { useTransaction }, async (context) => {
  for (const change of changes) {
    // ... deployment logic ...
    try {
      // ... execute change ...
    } catch (error: any) {
      // ... log error ...
      failed = change.name;
      throw error; // ‚Üê TERMINATES THE LOOP
    }
    
    // Stop if this was the target change
    if (toChange && change.name === toChange) {
      break;
    }
  }
});
```

The `for...of` loop is wrapped inside the `withTransaction` callback. When `throw error` is executed, it terminates the callback function, which terminates the entire deployment process.

## Common Misinterpretation Explained

### The "2 success + 2 failure events" Confusion

**User's Observation**: "Non-transaction mode: 2 success + 2 failure events (includes failure from transaction run)"

**Actual Explanation**: This comes from the "verify database state after constraint failure" test which:

1. **Runs transaction mode first** ‚Üí Creates 1 failure event
2. **Then runs non-transaction mode** ‚Üí Creates 1 additional failure event
3. **Accumulates events** ‚Üí Total: 2 success (from non-transaction) + 2 failures (1 from each mode)

**Key Point**: The 2 failure events are NOT from a single non-transaction run continuing after errors. They are from running the same failure scenario twice with different transaction modes.

### Test Evidence Supporting This Explanation

**Lines 213-214** in the test:
```typescript
const failEvents = partialState.events.filter((e: any) => e.event_type === 'deploy' && e.error_message);
expect(failEvents.length).toBe(2); // fail_on_constraint failure logged twice (transaction + non-transaction)
```

The comment explicitly states "logged twice (transaction + non-transaction)", confirming this interpretation.

## Comparison: Transaction vs Non-Transaction Modes

### Same Failure Scenario, Different Outcomes

| Aspect | Transaction Mode | Non-Transaction Mode |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Error Handling** | Stops immediately | Stops immediately ‚úÖ |
| **Database State** | Complete rollback (clean) | Partial deployment (mixed) |
| **Changes Table** | 0 rows (rollback) | 2 rows (successful changes persist) |
| **Events Table** | 1 failure event | 2 success + 1 failure event |
| **Database Objects** | None (clean state) | Schema + table exist (mixed state) |

### Key Insight from Test Comments (Lines 216-231)

```typescript
/*
 * KEY INSIGHT: Same failure scenario, different outcomes
 * 
 * Transaction mode:
 * - launchql_migrate.changes: 0 rows (complete rollback)
 * - launchql_migrate.events: 1 failure event (logged outside transaction)
 * - Database objects: none (clean state)
 * 
 * Non-transaction mode:
 * - launchql_migrate.changes: 2 rows (partial success)
 * - launchql_migrate.events: 2 success + 2 failure events (includes failure from transaction run)
 * - Database objects: schema + table exist (mixed state)
 * 
 * RECOMMENDATION: Use transaction mode (default) unless you specifically
 * need partial deployment behavior for incremental rollout scenarios.
 */
```

**Important**: The difference is in **state persistence**, not in **error handling behavior**. Both modes stop immediately on errors.

## Recommendations

### 1. Current Behavior is Correct ‚úÖ

No code changes are needed. Non-transaction mode already stops immediately when errors are thrown, as evidenced by:
- Test assertions showing 4th change never attempted
- Code analysis showing identical error propagation
- Explicit test comments confirming "deployment stops at first failure"

### 2. Use Transaction Mode by Default ‚úÖ

The existing default (`useTransaction: true`) is appropriate for most use cases because:
- **Clean rollback** on failures (no partial state)
- **Atomic deployments** (all-or-nothing)
- **Easier debugging** (no mixed states to analyze)

### 3. Use Non-Transaction Mode Only When Needed ‚ö†Ô∏è

Consider `useTransaction: false` only for specific scenarios:
- **Incremental rollout** where partial success is acceptable
- **Large deployments** where transaction timeouts are a concern
- **Manual recovery** scenarios where you want to preserve successful changes

### 4. Understanding Event Counts üìä

When analyzing event logs:
- **Single deployment run**: Events = successful changes + 1 failure (if any)
- **Multiple test runs**: Events accumulate across all runs in the same test database
- **Mixed mode tests**: Events from both transaction and non-transaction runs are combined

## Conclusion

The LaunchQL migration system's non-transaction mode error handling is working correctly. The deployment loop stops immediately on the first error in both transaction and non-transaction modes. The user's concern was based on a misinterpretation of test results where multiple deployment modes were tested sequentially in the same database, causing event accumulation.

**No code changes are required.** The current implementation properly handles errors and stops deployment at the first failure, regardless of transaction mode.
