## Developing

When first cloning the repo:

```sh
pnpm install
# build the prod packages. When devs would like to navigate to the source code, this will only navigate from references to their definitions (.d.ts files) between packages.
pnpm run build
```

Or if you want to make your dev process smoother, you can run:

```sh
pnpm install
# build the dev packages with .map files, this enables navigation from references to their source code between packages.
pnpm run build:dev
```
