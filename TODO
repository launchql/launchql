- [ ] remove travis
- [ ] 'getOne(): handles missing selection gracefully' NOT PASSING
- [ ] @launchql/react tests
- [ ] pg-ast should use pg-proto-parser's types (@pgsql/utils in pgsql-parser monorepo?)
- [ ] csv-to-pg should use enum strings for ops, and types too
- [ ] csv-to-pg should use inqurirer
- [ ] get this PR from launchql-gen https://github.com/launchql/launchql-gen/pull/19
- [ ] Docker in workflow needs extensions directories
- [ ] LaunchQL class for the project structures — control files, modules, paths, etc. 
- [ ] mod.setModuleDependencies(['some-native-module', 'pg-utilities']); allows for circular refs
- [ ] when deploy/**/some.sql requires a project, not detected by moduleDependencies, potentially write a method to extract these

Good next steps:
1. Get a demo script of creating some tables w the meta api 
2. Get export working 
3. Get boilerplate (lql init) working 
4. Get testing framework working (this will be HUGE)
