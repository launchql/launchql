TODO

CI / Workflow
-------------
- [x] Remove Travis CI
- [ ] Fix Docker workflow to include extensions directories

Testing & Stability
-------------------
- [ ] Fix 'getOne(): handles missing selection gracefully' test (currently failing)
- [ ] Add tests for @launchql/react
- [x] Get testing framework working (this will be huge)

Package Cleanup
---------------
- [ ] Remove shelljs
- [ ] Remove deployFast option
- [ ] Add keywords to package.json files in all packages

CSV-to-PG Improvements
----------------------
- [ ] Use enum strings for operation types
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Integrate inquirer for interactive prompts

Module System
-------------
- [ ] Fix mod.setModuleDependencies(['some-native-module', 'pg-utilities']) — currently allows circular references
- [ ] Detect project dependencies from deploy/**/some.sql if not declared via moduleDependencies

Naming & Typing
---------------
- [ ] pg-ast should adopt pg-proto-parser's types (from @pgsql/utils in pgsql-parser monorepo)
      pg-ast is a much better name — use it!

Migration & History
-------------------
- [ ] Get this PR from launchql-gen: https://github.com/launchql/launchql-gen/pull/19
- [ ] Move postgraphile-* plugins over (preserve import history)
- [ ] Import original LaunchQL history (preserve git log)

Misc
----
- [ ] Fix issue where `some-schema` must be renamed to `some_schema` during packaging to work

Good Next Steps
---------------
- [x] Demo script using meta API to create tables
- [x] Get export working
- [x] Get boilerplate (`lql init`) working
- [ ] Get testing framework finalized
