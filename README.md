## Overview

**LaunchQL** is a full-stack framework for building secure, role-aware, GraphQL-based backends using PostgreSQL. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and developer ergonomics for teams building production-grade applications on top of a strongly typed SQL core.

## ⚠️ Under Construction

Expect breaking changes, shifting APIs, and fast iteration as we build toward a stable release.

If you're experimenting or exploring, feel free to dive in — but for production use, proceed with caution and track updates regularly.
